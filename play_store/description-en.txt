Crypdroid allows you to safely encrypt your private texts and files.
The encrypted data can then be send via E-Mail, WhatsApp or SMS or can be stored in your DropBox. The possibilities vary depending on your installed Apps.
Crypdroid allows you to not only exchange encrypted texts and files between different Android devices but also to securely communicate with a PC. This is enabled through the free Open Source Software <a href='www.cryptool.org'>CrypTool 2</a>. Texts can be en- and decrypted between Crypdroid and the Cryptool 2 tool "encrypt with password".

Your data is encrypted with the cryptographic algorithm AES-256. Your data is encrypted with a session key that is derived from your password via the PKCS #5 standard. These algorithms provides a good balance between security and performance.
